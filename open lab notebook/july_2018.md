# week 02.07.-06.07.
- filled participant overview file with basic information and copied it to BIDS-folder
  - age, sex, handedness, musical training duration, current musical training, MET scores
  - had to calculate two MET scores manually (because the script did not work properly and the yes-key was not working (sub-02) or set to x and therefore not rateable via analysis-script (sub-05))
- wrote parts of method chapter of my thesis
  - stimuli 
  - preprocessing
- created events.tsv-files for each participant for each run
  - using a function that creates a new tsv.-file using information from the log-files (necessary file ends with trials.csv)
  - copied these files to the BIDS-folder on the server (in the func-folders of each participant)
- segmentation with freesurfer did not work optimal (but okay), so I looked at it again
  - guide to Inspection of Freesurfer Output: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview 
  - tutorial to correct severe segmentation errors: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/PialEdits_freeview
  - tried FreeSurfer QA Tool: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools 
    - many ERRORs I do not get (saying images would not be there that are there)
    - information if there are outliers in a subject
    - information about SNR
- run BIDS conversion and mriqc for the last two participants
- worked on firstlevel analysis and had first results: activation in auditory cortex is visible and differs from genre to genre!
  - have to look at the run-information-files again to be sure that the correct stimuli names are taken
  - have to write a loop to get all information for each run in each participant
