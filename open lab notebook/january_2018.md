# week 01.01.-05.01.
- BipoLife training in Dresden for job as student research assistant

# plan for this week
- transform psychopy-experiment
  - what do we use for calibration? Some of our stimuli or should we create a differing calibration-sound-file?
  - equal distribution of delays (4,6 or 8s) per run, so all runs have equal length
- write a script to read out the log-file output of the experiment and/or make it more clearly arranged
- commit revised ethic proposal
- structure of my thesis
- prepare short presentation about methods
