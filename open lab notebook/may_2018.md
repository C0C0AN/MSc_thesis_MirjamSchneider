# week 07.05.-09.05.
- worked on analysis script for questionnaire
- extracted some datasets (results from questionnaire)
- talked about possibilities to analyse questionnaire results

# week 14.05.-18.05.
- first analysis of questionnaire results (absolute frequency of occurrence of each stimulus in the first place)
  - we will analyse this using a point system so each rank gets a descending number of poinst (1-10p, 2-9p, 3-8p and so on) to gain information about relative frequency of occurance in higher positions of the stimuli 
  - we will analyse this using percent values (xy% of the participants used punk1 in first place etc.)
- worked on questionnaire analysis script 
  - some problems concerning python versions occurred
  - finally Peer found the solution to add a for-loop at the end of the script so that a dataframe with stimuli + summed weights is created
