# week 05.02.-09.02.
- clicked through whole experiment on my laptop
  - everything worked out, logfile and csvfile are written
- corrected some slides: break was time dependent (now only depends on key), deleted letsgoon-slide because I do not need a trigger regulated slide at this point in the experiment
  - transformed scanner protocol according to changes
- worked on my presentation on analysis methods

# week 12.02.-16.02.
- checked lab.js (https://felixhenninger.github.io/lab.js/) if it is an alternative to Jens questionnaire
  - I do not think so, it is more an alternative to psychopy, but I am not sure if auditory stimuli can be included at all (maybe using html)
  - different question types can be implemented using html (no gui) â€“ no difference to java script except it is a different language (tutorial: https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/forms/2-elements.html) 
- worked on presentation on methods (still reading the paper)
- wrote my project proposal for the local Brainimaging Facility
