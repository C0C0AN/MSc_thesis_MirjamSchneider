# week 02.05.-04.05.
- corrected online questionnaire and added some information to avoid missunderstandings
- worked on preprocessing pipeline for fMRI-data
  - looked for examples in literature
  - recapped some jupyter notebooks on this topic
  - got an example from Peer
- presentation on methods during brainhack
- presentation on music feature analysis, especially on pliers, during brainhack

# week 07.05.-09.05.
- worked on analysis script for questionnaire
- extracted some datasets (results from questionnaire)
- talked about possibilities to analyse questionnaire results

# week 14.05.-18.05.
- first analysis of questionnaire results (absolute frequency of occurrence of each stimulus in the first place)
  - we will analyse this using a point system so each rank gets a descending number of poinst (1-10p, 2-9p, 3-8p and so on) to gain information about relative frequency of occurance in higher positions of the stimuli 
  - we will analyse this using percent values (xy% of the participants used punk1 in first place etc.)
- worked on questionnaire analysis script 
  - some problems concerning python versions occurred
  - finally Peer found the solution to add a for-loop at the end of the script so that a dataframe with stimuli + summed weights is created

# week 27.05.-01.06.
- worked on feature extraction together with Klara
  - Peer helped me with pitch and timbre
- wrote one script to extract all features and save figures and an array for each feature
  - including for-loop through a folder including all stimuli
- tried to compute mahalanobis distance between different stimuli
  - arrays have to be transformed so that there are more observations (=rows) than dimensions (=columns) â†’ each value in its own row
  - matrices will be constructed using the mean value of each distance
  - did not figure out how to write matrices and now peer will have a look at it
   - he also changed some aspects in my feature extraction script concerning arguments like hop_size etc.
- Tested whole experiment at the scanner with Michael as participant 
  - one video stopped and we had to start it again (probably because of my usb-stick?)
  - using the video from Peers usb-stick everything worked out and the experiment runs completely
