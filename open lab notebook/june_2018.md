# week 04.06.-08.06.
- run quality control and freesurfer, ants and mindboggle segmentation of pilot data using docker images:
  - quality control: http://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docker.html 
  - freesurfer, ants, mindboggle: https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/mindboggle
- worked on preprocessing pipeline (using output of freesurfer)
- wrote a function to write event.csv files for each run with information from psychopy-log from scanner 
- tested my first participant including all parts of the study
  - everything worked fine, all in all I need about 3,5h for each participant

# week 11.06.-15.06.
- created NC2U_fmri_particitpant.tsv spreadsheet on google drive (belongs to BIDS structure)
  - includes most important demografic information about my participants 
- began to create supplemental_information.tsv (belongs to BIDS strucutre)
  - should include all information from music preference and handedness questionnaires 
- worked on events.tsv-files
  - changed colmn run to run_type and deleted the first index-column and the column for movie_stim
- created BIDS-files for data description (on the same level as sub-xy folders)
  - task-NC2U_bold.json and task-NC2U_beh.json (atm on /home/mirjam/Desktop/Masterarbeit/NC2U_BIDS)
- worked on preprocessing pipeline
  - have to include temporal lobe mask and coregistration of slab to t2 to t1
- tested 3 participants

# week 18.06.-22.06.
- worked on my preprocessing pipeline
  - one version using the freesurfer node “robustregister” to coregister epi slab and t2 whole brain
  - one version using the ants node “registration” to coregister epi slab and t2 whole brain
  - problems occur using these registration nodes, also the mask seems to be to strict 
- worked on my firstlevel analysis and finished a first version
  - I am not completely sure if I chose the right contrasts and did everything right
- tested more participants

# week 24.06.-29.06.
- changed buttons in frmi-experiment: y instead of 1 to go on so no confusion with esc is possible
- tested more participants
- changed some nodes in the preprocessing workflow
  - coregistration using bbregister (epi to t2 whole brain, t2 whole brain to brain.mgz)
  - normalization using antsregistration (brain.mgz to mni template (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009, ICBM 2009c Nonlinear Asymmetric template)
  - included BET to skullstrip mean images of realignment and to use these skulstripped mean images for coregistration later on
    - changed fractional intensity threshold for BET  (tried different values using the fsl gui)
    - frac = 0.3 for the skullstripping of epi mean
    - frac = 0.65 for the skullstripping of whole brain mean
    - frac = 0.3 for meanfuncmask
  - preprocessing: workflow is running except datasink
- Peer adjusted mindboggle process for 3T (was originally made for 1.5T) and took T2 into account
- created BIDS, defaced and run mriqc for participants 09-14
