# week 05.03.-09.03.
- checked experiment at the scanner again
  - updated ubuntu and removed and reinstalled psychopy first
  - the experiment worked through all runs and wrote normal log/csv files
  - maybe the reason for our problems was a missing update or my usb-stick
- wrote code to separate csv output of experiment in files for each run containing just the important information (onset, stimulus, run number)
there is a column with numbers in it â€“ I do not know why

# week 12.02.-16.02.
- visited talk of Michael Hanke
- visited TeaP
- worked on script to separate logfiles: found a solution to delete index-column and to rename the columns in the final output-files

# week 19.03.-23.03.
- wrote a first version of data management plan
- replaced some of the movie-files with less violent clips (also from the planet earth docu)

# week 26.03.-30.03.
- worked on a script to read out the output I get from the online stimulus validation survey
  - did not figure out yet how to convert json strings or objects zu python arrays
- learned more about music feature extraction and discovered some problems with using [bregman toolkit](https://github.com/bregmanstudio/BregmanToolkit) on my laptop
  - plan to have a closer look at [essentia](http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/) and [pliers](https://github.com/tyarkoni/pliers) as alternatives
