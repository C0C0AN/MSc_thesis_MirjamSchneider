# week 05.03.-09.03.
- checked experiment at the scanner again
  - updated ubuntu and removed and reinstalled psychopy first
  - the experiment worked through all runs and wrote normal log/csv files
  - maybe the reason for our problems was a missing update or my usb-stick
- wrote code to separate csv output of experiment in files for each run containing just the important information (onset, stimulus, run number)
there is a column with numbers in it â€“ I do not know why
