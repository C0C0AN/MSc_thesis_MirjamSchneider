# week 02.07.-06.07.
- filled participant overview file with basic information and copied it to BIDS-folder
  - age, sex, handedness, musical training duration, current musical training, MET scores
  - had to calculate two MET scores manually (because the script did not work properly and the yes-key was not working (sub-02) or set to x and therefore not rateable via analysis-script (sub-05))
- wrote parts of method chapter of my thesis
  - stimuli 
  - preprocessing
- created events.tsv-files for each participant for each run
  - using a function that creates a new tsv.-file using information from the log-files (necessary file ends with trials.csv)
  - copied these files to the BIDS-folder on the server (in the func-folders of each participant)
- segmentation with freesurfer did not work optimal (but okay), so I looked at it again
  - guide to Inspection of Freesurfer Output: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview 
  - tutorial to [correct severe segmentation errors](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/PialEdits_freeview)
  - tried [FreeSurfer QA Tool](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools) 
    - many ERRORs I do not get (saying images would not be there that are there)
    - information if there are outliers in a subject
    - information about SNR
- run BIDS conversion and mriqc for the last two participants
- worked on firstlevel analysis and had first results: activation in auditory cortex is visible and differs from genre to genre!
  - have to look at the run-information-files again to be sure that the correct stimuli names are taken
  - have to write a loop to get all information for each run in each participant

# week 16.07.-20.06.
- adjusted preprocessing workflow using coregistration routine of https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/notebooks/example_preprocessing.html
  - replaced bbregister with FLIRT
- changed some parameters in antsregistration and the template according to https://github.com/miykael/nipype_tutorial/blob/master/notebooks/scripts/ANTS_registration.py
  - also skullstripped template image 
- splitted preprocessing in one preproc workflow and one registration workflow
  - registration includes only ANTS-coreg to mni brain
- worked on preprocessing again: included new nodes (applywarp) like in the example above
  - applywarp seems to transform 4D images in 3D images and therefore artifact detection is no longer possible → tried different node ApplyFXM (FSL) → did not work out
  - tried bbregister again, but there the problem is that you cannot manually put a reference file but the node always uses an anatomical one → Peer and I are trying to find a solution 
- changed some output parameters of registration workflow and run it again on ubuntu
  - outputs (to datasink): warped_image, inverse_warped_image, composite_transform, inverse_composite_transform
  - it is running now
- wrote parts of master thesis
  - behavioral data acquisition, experimental design
