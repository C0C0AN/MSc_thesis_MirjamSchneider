# week 05.02.-09.02.
- clicked through whole experiment on my laptop
  - everything worked out, logfile and csvfile are written
- corrected some slides: break was time dependent (now only depends on key), deleted letsgoon-slide because I do not need a trigger regulated slide at this point in the experiment
  - transformed scanner protocol according to changes
- worked on my presentation on analysis methods
