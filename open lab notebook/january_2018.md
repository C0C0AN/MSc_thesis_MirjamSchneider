# week 01.01.-05.01.
- BipoLife training in Dresden for job as student research assistant

# week 08.01.-12.01.
- solved the "delay-problem" in my [script for design construction](https://github.com/MirjamSchneider/MSc_thesis_MirjamSchneider/blob/master/open%20lab%20notebook/make_design.py) using a list including every possible delay (4,6,8) 13 times where every index is picked once per run (added a delay of 0 for the last stimulus)
- submitted second version of ethic proposal
- tried the experiment at the scanner again: did a first functional scan and everything seems to work out
  - tried different values for field of view and other settings
  - wrote a first version of a scanner protocol to document these settings
  - simulated the (complete) experiment at the laptop to see what kind of result-files are written: writes a calibration.csv-file and a trials.csv-file, produces empty log-file and stopped after the forth run – why?
- wrote a first [structure of my thesis](https://github.com/MirjamSchneider/MSc_thesis_MirjamSchneider/blob/master/open%20lab%20notebook/structure_thesis.md)

# plan for this week
- commit revised ethic proposal
- work on psychopy-experiment and solve its problems
- prepare short presentation on methods (for next weeks meeting)
